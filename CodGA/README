This source code enables the user to apply the simple genetic 
algorithm to instances of the NK landscape model. The main purpose
of this code is to show how to use the functions for evaluating
candidate solutions on the NK instances generated with the provided
generator and for testing their optimality, discussed in

Pelikan, M., (2008). Analysis of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms 
and Genetic Algorithms on NK Landscapes. MEDAL Report No. 2008001.

To compile the code, run "make" in this directory. The result will
be an executable file "ga-nk" in the same directory.

The executable file take a file name of the instance to apply the
genetic algorithm to, which is provided as a command-line argument.
If the global optimum of the provided instance is known (should be
written in the instance file), the algorithm terminates when the 
optimum is found. Otherwise, the code stops when the maximum number
of generations is reached (initialized automatically to n). 

Example usage:
- To solve instance from file "nk_40_2.1", run
./ga-nk nk_40_2.1

The code is simple and quite well commented, but if you have any
questions, please don't hesitate to ask us via email. Doxygen
documentation included in the html subdirectory.
